## Overview

This repository contains the group project for STOR 664, Fall 2025.
Our objective is to **investigate the statistical relationship between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and cardiovascular mortality rates (CMR)** at the U.S. county level.

Our analysis utilizes **regression analysis** and **causal inference** techniques to model CMR as a function of PM2.5 levels, controlling for socioeconomic and demographic covariates found in `County_RAW_variables.csv`. This approach is informed by existing literature, such as Wyatt et al. (2020). The primary dataset, `County_annual_PM25_CMR.csv`, provides annual PM2.5 and CMR data per county.

## Project Phases

This project is divided into two parts to ensure a structured analysis and reproducibility:

### Part 1: Introduction and Data Exploration

- **Deadline:** November 16, 2025
- **Focus:** Research question definition, dataset identification, and preliminary exploratory analysis.
- **Status:** [Completed]

### Part 2: Analysis & Results, and Discussion

- **Deadline:** December 3, 2025
- **Focus:** Full statistical analysis (Regression, Lasso, Interaction models), model diagnostics, and interpretation of results.
- **Status:** [In Progress/Submitted]
